        <p> Hi, I'm Dylan Kayyem, a former Psychology & Philosophy graduate from the University of Colorado turned User Experience designer. At the beginning of January 2021, during the harsh reality of the Covid-19 epidemic, I made a pivotal career decision.
            I decided to change my career path because I had found my calling to be a UX Designer. I have always been passionate about technology but never applied myself 100% to the field & had always focused more on social sciences.
            After I graduated from the University of Colorado with two bachelor degrees, I planned on pursuing social work but upon further research discovered that a career in product design would allow me to do just this and much more. So with confidence and overwhelming passion, I enrolled in a 3-month boot camp at Brainstation. The experience enhanced my ambition ten-fold and gave me an educated understanding of how I can change the world as a product designer. As a designer, I can help others by empathizing with my users in a perfect combination of research methodology, human psychology & modern philosophy. I am eager to apply these skills in a position as a UX/UI Designer so that I can create ethical solutions to real world problems & enhance the world as we experience it subjectively.
            When i'm not obsessing over making my design's pixel perfect, I also love playing with my dog, Moose. You can check out his fun & exciting dog life on his @mooseforprez2020
            My passion for design started as an obsession for video games and all things nerdy. The game I was most obsessed with growing up would have to be, World of Warcraft. I started playing WoW when I was only 10 years old, the first online MMO game I had played, that ultimately changed my life forever. To be less dramatic about the game's impact on my life, it helped me socially and was a crutch during a socially awkward middle school era. 
            I was never considered nerdy or weird, but was simply uncomfortable with most, if not all, social situations at the time because I had no sense of direction.
            My parents thought video games weren't helpful to me and always told me, "stop wasting away your life behind a computer screen..." Looking back on it, my parents and I had no idea I was giving myself direction to become a digital designer, I just had not realised with clarity that was on my career path. All those 'wasted' hours behind my computer screen was my way of following my passion to be the best UX Designer I could be.
            As I experienced the game's monthly updates and continued to obsess over the pro's and con's of each change they implemented, I began to accumulate an objective understanding of what an efficient UX/UI design looks like. I don't play WoW nearly as much since high-school and will either play League of Legends or Fortnite when I have free leisure time.
            When i'm not at my computer, I like to keep my life active and spend my time creating memories with my family, friends, my fianc√©e & my dog! </p>
